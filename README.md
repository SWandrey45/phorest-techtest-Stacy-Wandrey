# phorest-techtest-Stacy-Wandrey
My tech test for the phorest grad programme! Woo hoo!

To begin this project, I decided to first plan my initial ideas for the tech stack. I knew several things from reading the project instructions: one being that I would need to access the API and return a json file that could be filtered to the specifications entered by the user. This I 

I needed to pick out: 
a web framework - would I use django or flask? I have experience with using both but which would be appropriate with this project? 
a language to type in - what would I use to make the HTML/CSS Dynamic? Javascript? React? why? 
I need to use bootstrap, it's an easy way to make the application look professional quickly! 
what would my mock ups look like? Should I optimise my style for mobile use? YES!! most people use their phones anyways and I have used my own phone for booking salon appointments and I hated their UI because it was not meant for mobile use, styling for multiple screens was something i want to maintian. 
a colour pallet - since this web app would be representing phorest, I decided to use the main colours of purple and white. then this application could seamlessly be added into the software :)

Why you made certain decisions over others, what did you take the time to learn? 

## Automated tests
## Testing JavaScript 
In order to set up tests, I had to do some research on the best way to handle testing my particular tech stack. As it stands I did not use a backend to connect to the API, so the application is made with two ajax called within two JavaScript functions.  so I started looking for the best way to handle the testing of my functions. There are several well known testing frameworks that go along with testing JavaScript like Mocha, Chai, Jasmine and Ava. 
## Nice UI
I stole the colours directly from the Phorest website so that the web app I made would be cohesive and on-brand with Phorest's image. 
## responsive for mobile 
based on a bad expeirience so I wanted to implement this change 
## Clean code
I mean just look at it! 
## Deploy code / give instructions on how to set up environments
You should see the app deployed here: 

Sending user input (which can contain unknown characters), POST is more robust and secure than GET.

##
curl request was bogus

## A place to grow and improve the lives of others 
Thank you very much for the opportunity to inteview and create this tech test! I hope it shows you what I am capable of and my passion for software engineering. I am happy to answer any questions about
